# Bmicalculator

This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator app built using Flutter. The app allows users to calculate their BMI based on their weight and height inputs.

## Features
- Calculate BMI: Input your weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters), and the app will calculate your BMI.
- Interpret BMI: The app interprets the calculated BMI value and provides information on whether the user is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
- Easy-to-Use Interface: The user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, making it easy for users to input their data and view the results.
